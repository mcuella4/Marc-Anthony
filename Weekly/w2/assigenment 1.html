	<h1>Web Site Critique</h1>
	<h2>The Bad</h2>
	<a href="http://arngren.net/">
		<img src="imagefile/Screenshot (1).png" alt="Screen of Arngren homepage" width="50%">
		<p>arngren site</p>
	</a>
	
	
<p>This webpage is very disorganized. It doesn't direct the viewer to any sort of topic or
products, it seems to be a website with many ads. The ads are all over the place, being
this an unorganized webpage.
</p>
	
	 
	<a href="http://www.bellads.info/">
		<img src="imagefile/Screenshot (2).png" alt="Screen of Bellads homepage" width="50%">
		<p>bellads site</p>
	</a>
		
		
<p>Another great example of an unorganized webpage. This Webpage doesn't have any
structure or any sort of design. Not having any background or an overall reason for a
viewer to see this webpage. And when opening this web page it automatically downloads
a document, which indicates an unsafe webpage.
</p>
	
	
	
       <h2>The Good</h2>
		<a href="https://www.carmax.com/">
			<img src="imagefile/Screenshot (3).png" alt="Screen of Carmax" width="50%"> 
			<p>carmax site</p>
		</a>
		
		
<p>This website is very organized having space between every image and text. This website
is very interesting to look, also straightforward and smooth transaction when it comes to
clicking each link. This is an advertisement website, it is very organized to direct
customers to the multiple products.
</p>
		
	
		<a href="https://www.nike.com/">
			<img src="imagefile/Screenshot (4).png" alt="Screen of Nike" width="50%">
			<p>nike site</p>
		</a>
	
		
<p>The visual aspect of this website is very important and what makes a really appealing
advertisement website. Having a smooth transaction of their products and very organized on the
different products that the company is selling. The design of the site is what really makes the
website a great website.
